#### About myself:
Being bored during the quarantine in 2020, I got interested in learning IT. After I gained knowledge of types of IT, I decided first to learn front end development and after back end, because front end development is easier than back end.

After approximately 2 month of learning I stopped, because I lost interest. In 2021 when I graduated westminster lyceum, as lot of friends of mine were programming applications and other stuff, I got interested in it again. So I started learning HTML CSS and Javascript.

In 2021 september me and my brother decided to open educational center called "_Knowledge Academy Group_", where students are being taught IT and foreign languages.

I strongly believe that my abilities and urge to self-improvement and prioritization will help me to reach my goal and become senior full-stack developer.
